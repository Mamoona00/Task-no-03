* How to check if a string is a valid keyword in Python?
In Python, while writing a program sometimes we use the keyword as a string and there interpreter throws an error.
For this problem, we use iskeyword() function from the keyword library to check whether the string we used is a valid keyword or not.

* How to assign a value to a variable in Python and other programming languages?
A variable can be a name in which we can store any value. x=3 x is the name of the variable and  is the value assigned to a variable.
In Python assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. In other programming languages, we have to declare a datatype but in Python, we assign value to the variable directly without declaring a datatype.
We can assign values to multiple variables by separating them with commas.

*How to print without newline in Python?
In Python by default when we print something we get each each text in a new line.
For printing without a new line, we use the end parameter then equals to (=), and then double quotations (" ").
Another method is the use of a sys module.

*Decision-making in python:

*Basic calculator program using Python:
For making a calculator program we will use variables, conditional statements, and operators.
First, we will take 2 numbers as input from the user. input() will used to get input from the user.
Then we will print operations. print() is used to print the name of operations.
After that, we will give a choice to the user to select an operation to be performed on numbers.
At the end, we will print the result using conditional statements.


*Python language advantages and applications:
python is used in:
web development (websites)
Desktop applications (can't be used on Android) e.g ai quizzer
Software development
Database applications
Gaming development
companies used Python for data analysis
Artificial Intelligence
Python Language has many advantages:
It is free and easy.
Opensource.
Easily understood by humans.
You don't need to declare data type.
It can be used on any platform.
Code written in other languages can ported to Python.
The interpreter executes the code of Python line by line.
python has less syntaxes and rules.
